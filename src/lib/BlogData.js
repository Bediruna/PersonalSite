        "excerpt": "My name \"Bedir\" is the Turkish version of the Arabic name \"Badr\" (بَدْر), meaning full moon. It's pronounced closest to the English word \"better\". I sometimes get a kick out of introducing myself as \"Better\", as in \"Hi, I'm John!\" 🫱🏻 \"Hi, I'm Better\" 🫲🏻😌 but rest assured, that's not the exact proper pronunciation (if English is your only language, sorry but, you're def not going to pronounce it 💯%) (and I'm not actually that arrogant). \nMy Github username \"Bediruna\" (بَدْرُنَا)  is a combination of my name and the suffix \"una\" (نَا) which means \"ours\" in Arabic. \nTherefore, when combined, \"Badruna\" signifies \"our full moon,\" often used metaphorically to describe something or someone as a source of great beauty, light, or guidance for a group of people. This is a nickname that my father calls me, so this a nod to him.",
