# Personal Site for Bedir.dev

This is my personal site that includes my resume, work experience, education, and certifications.

I built it with SvelteKit, because I truly believe in the technology. It serves the page in a lightweight and compact way that I love. Perhaps I could've just served the content in pure HTML and CSS, but I do have plans to expand this website a bit to include a blog for explaining the reasoning behind some of my projects.
